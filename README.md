Automates the process of aligning and stitching panoramas ranging from 2 to 255 photos with a maximum output of 4GB.

Designed for use with Google Cloud and Dropbox to parallelize and accelerate panorama creation. Measured performance boosts of roughly 10000% for large batch jobs and 800% for individual 1GB panoramas, as compared to 4-core 2013 Intel i7 processor at ~3GHz and 16GB DDR3 RAM.

**Work-in-progress suitable only for enthusiast use.**

The project complicated and undergoing a major overhaul, so maintaining instructions is not feasible. **Contact routtaudrey@seattleu.edu for a walk-through.**
